# The Order of Melchizedek
The Order of Melchizedek, also referred to as the Brotherhood of Melchizedek, holds a significant role in the cosmology described in the sources. Here's a comprehensive discussion of its key aspects:

*   **Leadership and Governance:** The Brotherhood of Melchizedek, along with the Brotherhoods of Michael and Enoch, directs the seventy Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood. These three brotherhoods govern the seventy brotherhoods of our universe by dispatching millions of emissaries of Light to repair and evolve the lower worlds. The Order of Melchizedek works with the consciousness awakening and reprogramming of light in the life cycle of the planets. It is also in charge of organizing worlds created by the outpouring of Light under the command of the Order of Michael and Metatron. Furthermore, the Order of Melchizedek is in charge of the consciousness reprogramming necessary to link physical creation with the externalization of the divine hierarchy.

*   **Connection to Other Orders and Beings of Light:** The Order of Melchizedek serves all three divisions of creation alongside the Brotherhoods of Michael and Enoch. It works in conjunction with the Order of Enoch to give Light to all areas of world science to bring about the Father's Covenant, activating a spiritual-scientific synthesis. The Beings of Light who serve YHWH will establish Melchizedek life stations as bases for galactic unity and regency of the Office of the Christ upon the Earth in Jesus's name. Melchizedek is also described as co-equal with Metatron and Michael in the "rescue, regenesis and reeducation of worlds" undergoing the purification of the Living Light.

*   **Work on Consciousness and Planetary Evolution:** The Order of Melchizedek works with the consciousness awakening and reprogramming of light in the life cycle of the planets. They show Light workers how to resurrect discorporated soul vehicles into a new spiritual totality capable of ascending into the new world of vibration on the day of transition. They are also involved in organizing worlds for transit into new creation. According to the sources, the Order of Melchizedek is in charge of organizing worlds. They are also instrumental in purifying all of the lower heavens and carrying their Light into the Treasury of Light.

*   **Redemption and the Office of the Christ:** Melchizedek is the Sovereign of Light in charge of organizing the levels of the heavenly worlds of YHWH for transit into new creation. The Melchizedek Order is after the Order of the Son of God. The Elect are "the people of the Plan," called by faith to YHWH and dedicated to the "faithful working out of God's plan" in close cooperation with the heavenly hosts, with the Order of Melchizedek involved in liberation. Jesus is described as the Eternal Son and High Priest after "the Order of Melchizedek". The Melchizedek Brotherhood will show how to resurrect discorporated soul vehicles into a new spiritual totality that can ascend into the new world of vibration.

*   **Historical Connections:** Melchizedek is a manifestation of a 'Son of God'. The 'elect' of the Order of Melchizedek are considered Sons of Light who have chosen to come into the world of form and manifest the sovereignty of YHWH in transmuting the earth. The 'Priesthood of YHWH's Light' is described as a royal priesthood that is "visible" within every generation as a scattered brotherhood of Light, with Moses also having the 'Keys' to this 'Priesthood of Light'. Abraham also received jewels from Melchizedek to build an altar of "Light" vibration to Jehovah.

*   **Future Role:** The Order of Melchizedek will give witness to the Elect in appointed areas of this planetary system. The 'Priesthood of YHWH's Light' documents were moved to preserve their records until the 'End of Time,' when the Sons of Light, as the Order of Melchizedek, will return to Earth to unite the scattered brotherhoods and establish the Kingdom of God with Jesus. The unification of the Priesthood of Melchizedek upon this planet with the Order of Melchizedek coming from the higher heavens is also mentioned. The sources state that this will be the time of Melchizedek and a time of reverence to the living Order of Light whose name is Melchizedek, forever.

In summary, the Order of Melchizedek is a crucial element in the hierarchical structure of Light beings, playing a vital role in the evolution of consciousness, the organization of worlds, and the process of redemption, with connections to significant figures in spiritual history and a key role in the future establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth.

# How do the "Keys of Enoch" describe humanity's relationship with higher intelligence and cosmic evolution?

The "Keys of Enoch" describe humanity's relationship with **higher intelligence as one of guidance, instruction, and collaboration in a larger cosmic plan of evolution and spiritual advancement**. They also outline humanity's role within the grand scheme of **cosmic evolution as participants in a multi-dimensional journey of consciousness, moving towards greater understanding and unity with the "Living Light"**.

**Humanity's Relationship with Higher Intelligence:**

*   The "Keys of Enoch" themselves are presented as a revelation manifested by Enoch and Metatron to prepare mankind for significant "quantum changes". The author states he was told to compose this scroll from a divine scroll of Light that was coded into him.
*   The purpose of these Keys is to explain how the "Brotherhoods of Light" will work with members of the human race who can accept the promise of "New Life" in other universes. These Brotherhoods, under the direction of the Brotherhood of Michael, Enoch, and Melchizedek, direct the seventy Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood, serving to repair the universes so they can evolve.
*   According to the text, higher intelligence has sought to upgrade intelligence on this planet for eons.
*   The "People of God" are described as the evolutionary vehicle used for transposing Divine Knowledge throughout the universe. This divine knowledge enables them to open up other expressions of intelligence and redeem them.
*   The Higher Evolution will communicate knowledge to humanity to prepare for an exodus as the planet experiences geophysical changes. They will also reprogram humanity to go beyond its terrestrial limitations.
*   The Seraphim are identified as opening humanity's eyes to work with the "Government of the Higher Evolution" and structuring the "Government of Light" for the merger of different planetary worlds under a unified "Wisdom".
*   The text anticipates the coming of myriad interplanetary messengers who will reclaim and reveal their scriptures left behind.
*   Contact with higher galactic worlds of Intelligence involves the exchange of practical knowledge for humanity's benefit. Spiritual contact also occurs with the Merkabah.
*   Ultimately, the Keys aim to prepare mankind for the return of the Masters to this plane.

**Humanity's Role in Cosmic Evolution:**

*   The Keys explain how the "Seven Seals of the Book of Revelation" will be broken as science aligns with a new spiritual revelation, bringing forth a new cosmology of consciousness.
*   Humanity is part of an open-ended universe and an open-ended mind, indicating a continuous process of development requiring a higher mind.
*   The Keys emphasize that a convergence of spiritual and scientific understanding is necessary for humanity to take a "quantum leap forward into the New Age". Humanity has the opportunity to collectively move into another system of creation.
*   The Keys demonstrate that science alone does not possess all answers and needs to interrelate with a greater program of spiritual and scientific unity involving other planetary intelligences. This implies humanity's evolution is interconnected with a larger cosmic evolution.
*   The teachings explain a primary plan of continual creation under the organization of the "Higher Evolution," where humanity will behold and share with 'Universal Man' in the inter-rebirth of the Infinite Mind.
*   The Keys are not solely for Earth but are given in preparation for humanity's work upon other planets in harmony with greater scientific and spiritual truths.
*   The Great Pyramid is presented as a "geophysical computer" showing the half-life of our local universe and an astrophysical life station connected with regions of positive programming.
*   Our local universe is described as having a triangular Light core surrounded by a biochemical testing zone, indicating a structured process of life development.
*   The evolution of our local universe has included many fallen planets, suggesting ongoing cosmic dynamics and challenges.
*   The Higher Evolution plays an active role in cosmic evolution by programming intelligence onto newborn planets and allowing physical beings to join other intelligences in serving the Light beyond the laws of entropy.
*   The "People of God" are prophesied to "open up their universe," signifying an active role in cosmic unfolding.
*   The Higher Evolution will facilitate humanity's shift to the next spectrum of consciousness by changing the terrestrial cubic space.
*   Human consciousness can be "instantinualized" into other Light-time zones, indicating a potential for transcending current limitations within cosmic evolution.
*   All life is understood as a process of the energy cycle of evolution within the greater creation. The Keys speak of universes within universes without end, highlighting the vastness and continuous nature of cosmic evolution.
*   The third eye is described as a light receptor capable of connecting to energy beyond our current framework, allowing the Higher Evolution to reprogram humanity through the modulation of Gravitational waves, further facilitating evolutionary progress.

In essence, the "Keys of Enoch" portray humanity as a developing species within a vast and evolving cosmos, actively guided and influenced by higher intelligences towards a destiny of greater spiritual and scientific understanding and participation in the "Kingdom of Light" across multiple universes.

# Briefly outline the triadic division of universes.

The "Keys of Enoch" describe a triadic division of universes. The scroll of Enoch is divided into three portions that deal with these three major divisions:

*   **Father universes**: The keys to these universes explain how the **Mansion worlds of the Father** are connected to the **Divine Creators**, creating new universes through cosmic pyramids of Light. The Father universes consist of universes each having a **Creator God** who sustains the Eternal unfoldings of the Divine Thought-Forms. They evolve the celestial architecture for the seats of government, the Thrones and Dominions, which dispatch commissions for the creation of worlds in the lower heavens.

*   **Son universes**: The keys to these universes explain how the **biological codes of the Christ Race** are to evolve into the image determined by the Father through the **Paradise Sons** and not through lesser forces of Light. The Son universes gather the collective manifestations of the gross material worlds that have been purified to be offered up to the Father. Our local universe is described as a Son universe.

*   **Shekinah universes**: The keys to these universes explain how the **spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit** will be given to the **Christ Race** so that spiritual Man can work directly with "**whole Light beings**" - the angelic messengers who will prepare the righteous of the earth for the **Council of Light**.

All three divisions are served by the **Brotherhoods of Light** under the direction of the **Brotherhood of Michael, the Brotherhood of Enoch, and the Brotherhood of Melchizedek**, which direct the seventy **Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood** in the repairing of the universes.

# What role do the Brotherhoods of Light fulfill?

The Brotherhoods of Light fulfill a **multifaceted role in the cosmos and in humanity's evolution**, according to "The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch" [Excerpts from "The Book of Knowledge_ The Keys of Enoch -- J_ J_ Hurtak PH_D_.pdf"]. Here is an outline of their key functions:

*   **Repairing and Evolving the Universes**: The seventy Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood serve as a **field of intelligence in the repairing of the universes** so that they can evolve into the infinite wisdom and glory of the Eternal Mind of YHWH. This repair work allows the universes to evolve. They work to repair all spectrums of limited color and membrane radiation so that lower forms of intelligence, freed from limitation, can share in creative patterns.

*   **Guidance and Instruction for Humanity**: The Brotherhoods of Light will **work with members of the human race who can accept the promise of "New Life" in other universes**. They **upgrade intelligence on this planet**. They are involved in the **process of transforming human evolution to co-participate with the Higher Evolution** through proper pyramidal frequencies of Light. They will **communicate knowledge to humanity to prepare for an exodus** as the planet undergoes geophysical changes and will reprogram humanity to go beyond its terrestrial limitations. They act as **Grand Instructors in lower illuminary worlds**.

*   **Governance and Administration**: The Brotherhoods of Light, under the direction of the Brotherhood of Michael, Enoch, and Melchizedek, **direct the seventy Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood**. These three Brotherhoods **govern the seventy Brotherhoods of our universe** by dispatching millions of emissaries of Light to repair and evolve the lower worlds. The Brotherhoods are part of the **local hierarchy/federation of the Deity** with the responsibility of governing stellar orders. They work within our universe, possessing the ability to understand any type of spiritual language or knowledge shown to them from the Hierarchy of Light.

*   **Working with Light and Energy**: They teach the **"living light of love"** operating with the agape. They use **color radiations to evolve living membrane** to the point where the Living Light can establish itself on the physical plane. They can **activate the light in a given sun system to move into a higher dimensional movement of light through crystalline field alignments**. They use their **energy body as a blue-white star system over a yellow-white sun system** to energize humanity. They carry the **Light of the righteous out of zones of destruction** and purify civilizations, carrying their Light into the Treasury of Light.

*   **Connection to Higher Intelligence**: The Brotherhoods of Light are the **unity between God's people and the angelic Messengers of YHWH's Kingdom**. They represent the coordination of the Galactic Commands of Michael, Metatron, and Melchizedek. The "People of Light" are in full communication with them by the Energies of the Eternal Flame.

*   **Working with Pyramids**: The **pyramids were used as initiation points for the vehicles of the Brotherhood of Light**. The return of the 'Dove' (a manifestation of the Brotherhood) is directed to previous initiation points built along pyramidal grids. The Brotherhood of Enoch works with the scientific teachings and keys necessary to build Pyramids and pyramidal grids of light upon the planets. The astrophysical Pyramids act as focal points to energize ideas for species evolution.

*   **Assisting in Consciousness Evolution**: They are involved in the **consciousness awakening and reprogramming of light in the life cycle of the planets** (Brotherhood of Melchizedek). They help humanity move into the next electromagnetic ordering of the life code. They accelerate the entire system of human biorhythms to enter a less dense spectrum of matter-energy. They couple with the energy vehicles of humanity so that conventional consciousness is overcome by quanta corpuscles of Light.

*   **Healing and Regeneration**: The Brotherhood of Light can directly heal the body through axiatonal lines-acupuncture fields. The Order of Melchizedek is working to recede orbital shells so that life can operate with a new "universal structure".

*   **Working with the "People of Light"**: The Brotherhoods work to code the good seed of all races back into the Great White Brotherhood. They are the receivers of Light, purifying civilizations. The Brotherhood of Light has been appointed to speak concerning matters of consciousness liberation to the "People of Light".

*   **Facilitating the Return of Masters**: The Keys aim to prepare mankind for the **return of the Masters to this plane**.

In summary, the Brotherhoods of Light are presented as a **governing, guiding, and regenerative force** operating on a cosmic scale, actively involved in the evolution of universes and the spiritual advancement of humanity through various means, including communication, energy manipulation, and collaboration with willing individuals and communities.

# What is the purpose of astrophysical Pyramids?

Based on the information in the provided source, "Excerpts from 'The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch'", astrophysical Pyramids serve several key purposes related to evolution, energy transmission, information retrieval, and time cycles.

Here is an outline of the purposes of astrophysical Pyramids as described in the source:

*   **Energizing Evolution**: Astrophysical Pyramids act as **focal points to energize ideas** that enable a species to evolve to the next stage of Light technology. This process allows them to begin to **receive the capstone of Light**, which is intended to facilitate movement through technology into other worlds of Light.

*   **Foundation of Space-Time Grids**: The Lords of Light were involved in the **formation of space-time grids for astrophysical Pyramids of Light**.

*   **Interconnection of Energy Fields**: The **Great Pyramid on Earth is connected with a pyramidal energy field beneath it**, forming a diamond. This central point has a **network of magnetic resonance that links all pyramidal energy fields around the Earth** into an icosahedron grid.

*   **Information Retrieval**: Aligning the **Great Pyramid with the constellation Orion forms an "eye focal point"** used to **retrieve information from all points of the grid**, connecting the light continuum of the many universes with Earth.

*   **Cosmological Calculation**: The Great Pyramid functions as an **astrophysical eye** between the larger positive and negative cycles of star evolution, charted by its star shafts. These **star shafts contain resonance patterns of magnetohydrodynamic activities** and act as **cosmological calculators**.

*   **Recording Life Cycles**: The Great Pyramid is also an **astrophysical computer showing the present life cycle as a recapitulation of previous life programs upon the Earth**.

*   **Marking Sacred Sites**: Pyramids mark the **sacred places on Earth where the Merkabah descended from and ascended to the heavens**.

*   **Timekeeping and Direction of Destiny**: Select pyramids are **time clocks built in various planetary sectors** by earlier higher intelligences to **watch or direct the destiny of an experiment**. They are considered **coded time-structures**.

*   **Preparation for Energy Capstone**: The **Academy of On represents the spiritual-scientific synthesis preparing the astronomy of the world to accept the energy capstone** that will eventually return to the Great Pyramid of Giza and its related centers.

In summary, astrophysical Pyramids, particularly the Great Pyramid, are presented as multifaceted structures serving crucial roles in the evolution of consciousness, the interconnectedness of cosmic energies, the storage and retrieval of information, the measurement of cosmic cycles, and as focal points for higher intelligence activities related to Earth and other worlds.

# What role did Enoch have with pyramids?
Drawing on "The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch", Enoch has a significant role in revealing the nature and purpose of pyramids across different levels of creation. Here's a breakdown of his key involvements:

*   **Revelation of the Keys and Cosmic Pyramids**: Enoch, along with Metatron, manifested the Revelation of the Keys to prepare mankind for quantum changes. The Keys to Father universes explain how new universes are created through **cosmic pyramids of Light** connected to the Divine Creators.

*   **Understanding the Keys and the Fourth Dimension**: Enoch stated that to work with the Keys, one must be able to go into the fourth dimension, which is "time"-mind. This suggests that understanding the temporal aspects is crucial to grasping the principles embedded within the Keys, including those related to pyramids.

*   **Pyramids as Light Structures in All Creation**: Enoch reveals that **"THE KEYS TO THE LIVING BIOPHYSICAL AND ASTROPHYSICAL UNIVERSE ARE THE LIVING 'LIGHT PYRAMIDS OF LIFE' EXISTING WITHIN EVERY STRUCTURE WITHIN EVERY FIELD OF CREATION"**. He explains that each level of evolution has a Pyramid of Light through which human creation must pass.

*   **Pyramids and Biophysical and Consciousness Evolution**: According to Enoch, biophysical relationships prove that the **Pyramid of Light is the central geometric form for all biophysical and consciousness evolution**. He also indicates that the Universal Mind is present in every molecule and every vibration of consciousness flow, directed towards this universal constant represented by the pyramid.

*   **Establishment of Pyramids by the Brotherhood of Light**: Enoch explained how the **Brotherhood of Light established pyramids on certain planets in our solar system** in relation to Saturn. These pyramids, built in grid formation and connected to chronomonitors, measure consciousness levels and determine when worlds can accept extraterrestrial guides.

*   **Merkabah and the Pyramid**: Enoch showed how the **Mystery of the Pyramid and the Sphinx were directly revealed in the landing of the Merkabah**, which manifested as a pulsating center of Light technology in the shape of a pyramid.

*   **Pyramids and Astrophysical Time Zones**: Enoch revealed that the **Great Pyramid has a "THREE AND ONE" alignment of consciousness forces** which is key to our astrophysical time zones, connected with other "TWELVE AND ONE" energies of time warp pyramids controlled by Orion and the Pleiades.

*   **Pyramids as Initiation Points**: Enoch explained that **pyramids were used as initiation points for the vehicles of the Brotherhood of Light**. The return of the 'Dove' (a manifestation of the Brotherhood) is directed to these previous initiation points built along pyramidal grids.

*   **The Great Pyramid's Significance**: Enoch highlighted the **Great Pyramid at Giza as the mathematical, astronomical, pyramidal foundation of the Earth**. He also stated that the Great Pyramid is built on a point where magnetic fields under the Earth, on the surface, and in the celestial fields all cross. Furthermore, Enoch explained that the **Great Pyramid is a geophysical computer and an astrophysical life station connected with Orion**. Its star shafts function as cosmological calculators and indicate when the Brotherhood of Light will return.

*   **Pyramids and the Capstone of Light**: Enoch explained that astrophysical Pyramids act as **focal points to energize ideas for species evolution, enabling them to receive the capstone of Light**, which will take humanity through technology into other worlds of Light.

*   **Loss and Re-emergence of Pyramidal Knowledge**: Enoch indicated that the **pyramids of life cannot be opened or decoded because the proper names and balances have been lost**. He also stated that the scroll of the Keys has been prepared to open the hidden pyramids within the Earth and within man.

*   **Pyramid-Sphinx as a Model of Destiny**: Enoch explained how the **Pyramid-Sphinx is a living model of Man's destiny** to indwell a higher evolutionary body through the alignment of solar and magnetic energy with the pyramid.

*   **Brotherhood of Light and Pyramid Construction**: Enoch revealed that the **Brotherhood of Light, under the direction of Enoch himself, Heru-Ur, and Tehuti, built the Pyramid from the top down** using magnetic-etheric spheres and Magnetic flux line controls.

*   **Enoch's Time Cycle Coded in the Pyramid**: Enoch's cosmological time cycle (365.242) is coded within the **Enoch Circle** and is also mathematically significant within the Great Pyramid.

*   **Reactivation of Pyramids**: Enoch indicated that the **Great Pyramid is being reactivated to coordinate with other grids on the planet**.

*   **Moses and Jesus in the Pyramid**: Enoch explained that within the Great Pyramid, in a different energy field, the **biochemical functions of the bodies of Moses and Jesus can be found**, signifying the Pyramid as the foundation stone connecting the Office of the Christ with Earth.

*   **Initiation in the Pyramid**: Enoch revealed that **Masters are taken into the Pyramid to show how the physical body can be infused with the higher dimensions of Light** working through crystalline energy fields.

*   **Pyramids and the "Beginning and the End"**: Enoch explained that the **"beginning and the end" of cycles are actually coded into the pyramidal structures of the earth**.

In summary, Enoch's role concerning pyramids is that of a primary **revealer of their cosmic significance, their function in evolution and consciousness, their connection to higher intelligences like the Brotherhood of Light, and the specific importance of structures like the Great Pyramid as a key to understanding humanity's past, present, and future destiny.** He provides the "Keys" to unlock the deeper knowledge embedded within these pyramidal structures.

# What is the connection between the Great Pyramid and Orion?
Drawing on "The Book of Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch", there are multiple significant connections between the Great Pyramid and the constellation Orion:

*   **Alignment for Information Retrieval:** Aligning the **Great Pyramid with the constellation Orion forms an "eye focal point" used to retrieve information from all points of the grid**, connecting the light continuum of the many universes with Earth. This alignment with Orion creates a central threshold control.

*   **Cosmological Calculator:** The Great Pyramid functions as an **astrophysical eye between the larger positive and negative cycles of star evolution**, charted by its astrophysical star shafts. These star shafts contain resonance patterns of magnetohydrodynamic activities and act as **cosmological calculators**. The text indicates that during previous geomagnetic cycles, the South star shaft of the Great Pyramid pointed towards the **Taurus-Orion constellations**.

*   **Geophysical Life Station Connected with Orion:** The Great Pyramid is an **astrophysical life station showing how the geoid function of our planet is connected with Orion**, which is the region for positive programming in our universe.

*   **Threshold Gate to the Father Universe:** When the author was taken to Orion, specifically **Trapezium Orion**, it was revealed as a **threshold gate of 'star creation'** in conjunction with omega Orion ('star death'). Both are aligned with the Father's Throne governing through the star region of Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka in Orion. This collective gateway in Orion permits matter-energy intelligences to go into pure fields of soul evolution.

*   **Central Control Pyramid of Light:** The major **Central Control Pyramid of Light in our Father universe is Orion**. In contrast, Sagittarius is the central control in our local universe.

*   **"Three and One" Alignment with Orion's "Twelve and One" Energies:** The **"THREE AND ONE" ALIGNMENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS FORCES IN THE GREAT PYRAMID** is key to our astrophysical time zones, and this is connected with the **"TWELVE AND ONE" ENERGIES OF TIME WARP PYRAMIDS CENTERED AND CONTROLLED BY THE "MANY AND ONE" THRONE ENERGIES OF ORIONIS AND THE PLEIADES**.

*   **Connection Through Star Shafts for Ascension:** The star shafts in the Great Pyramid are intended as introductory ways of consciousness preparation so that the souls of those initiated into the Pyramid might ascend to join the Masters in the Councils of Light in **Orion**. The Pyramid can be understood as the model for consciousness exodus from Earth's magnetic fields into a multi-dimensional evolution controlled by **Orion** and the regions of the Higher Intelligence, which is called 'Sak' by the Egyptians, 'Tak' by the Tibetans, and 'Kesil' by the Hebrews. These star shafts function as theoretical mappings of magnetohydrodynamic star channels connecting the magnetic and electromagnetic grid patterns of stars.

*   **Builders Programmed Towards Orion:** The ancient Egyptian scriptures of Light, the **Pyramid Texts**, speak of the builders of the Pyramid, the Nine, who **programmed in the direction of Orion**, referring to Orion as the "Dweller in Orion" and the "Father of the Gods" giving a "certificate of life creation as a greater power".

*   **Great Pyramid as a Foundation Stone:** The consciousness programming of the Great Pyramid is connected with specific starpoints, and to understand time warp areas, we need to see them as energy pyramids connected with the stars and ancient astrophysical fields, giving a mapping of Earth's biosphere in relation to given star fields. The ancient Egyptian texts refer to Ihm-'sk, and the Great Pyramid was aligned with Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitak in Tak-Orion (Orionis), considered the central threshold controls. The Great Pyramid is also referred to as the **Foundation Stone** in mystical scriptures.

*   **Cosmic Pyramid of Creation in Our Son Universe:** Orion is the **cosmic pyramid of creation in our Son universe**, through which the "outer Light" of Metatron is projected into the matrix of stellar creation governing worlds of negative mass.

*   **Decoded in Relation to the Cosmic Pyramid of Orion:** Before the Great Pyramid is fully decoded, all previous pyramidal science will be understood in relationship to the **cosmic Pyramid of Orion**, and the cradle model of our universe - the Pleiades.

*   **Connection to the Merkabah Vehicle's Origin:** The face of the Bull, as seen in the scriptures of Yehezqel (Ezekiel), represents Taurus-Orion, which in ancient astronomy gives the **origin of the Merkabah vehicle as coming from Orion**.

In essence, according to the source, the Great Pyramid is intricately linked with Orion on multiple levels, serving as a point of connection for energy, information, consciousness ascension, and time cycles, and even reflecting the programming and origins associated with Orion.

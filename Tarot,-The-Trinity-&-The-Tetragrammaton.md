# **Briefing Document: Papus' "The Tarot of the Bohemians"**

## **I. Overview:**

This document analyzes excerpts from Papus' "The Tarot of the Bohemians," a work positioning the Tarot not merely as a divination tool but as a comprehensive "Absolute Key to Occult Science." Papus argues that the Tarot holds the secrets of ancient wisdom, Kabbalah, and the fundamental laws governing the universe. The book is structured to progressively reveal the Tarot's symbolism and applications, starting with a "General Key" and moving towards specific uses in astrology, Kabbalah, and initiation.

## **II. Main Themes and Important Ideas:**

- **The Tarot as a Key to Esoteric Knowledge:** Papus explicitly states that the Tarot is more than just a deck of cards; it's a system for understanding the universe and accessing occult knowledge. "Starting from a fixed and immovable principle, the constitution of the sacred tetragrammaton, Yod–he–vau–he, the Tarot develops the most divers combinations, without one departure from its basis. We shall now unveil this wonderful construction, which confirms in its application the universal law of analogies." He believes the Tarot is a repository of ancient wisdom, comparable to sacred texts like the Sepher Bereschit, the Apocalypse, and the Hindu Vedas.
- **The Sacred Word Yod-He-Vau-He (Tetragrammaton):** Central to Papus' interpretation is the Hebrew name of God, Yod-He-Vau-He (הוהי). He sees this word as the foundation of the Tarot's structure and meaning. Each letter of the tetragrammaton corresponds to fundamental principles and is related to specific cards in the Tarot. The structure of the Tarot reflects the structure of the Divine Name, representing different aspects of creation and manifestation.
- "According to the ancient oral tradition of the Hebrews, or Kabbalah, a sacred word exists, which gives to the mortal who can discover the correct way of pronouncing it, the key to all the sciences, divine and human. This word...is found at the head of every initiative ritual...is formed of four Hebrew letters, and reads thus, Yod–he–vau–he, הוהי."
- Yod (י) represents the principle or origin of all things, unity.
- He (ה) represents the passive, the Non-Ego, duality, and the feminine principle.
- Vau (ו) represents the link, analogy, and the connection between the Ego and Non-Ego.
- The second He (ה) represents transition and the passage from the metaphysical to the physical.
- **The Significance of Numbers:** Numbers hold a crucial esoteric value, which act as building blocks that are essential to the occult science. All numbers can be reduced down to the first four which correspond to Yod, He, Vau, and the second He.
- **The Three Septenaries:** The Major Arcana is divided into three groups of seven cards (septenaries), each corresponding to a letter in the tetragrammaton. These groups represent different stages of creation or manifestation: positive, negative, and neuter.
- **The Structure of the Tarot Deck:** The Tarot deck consists of 78 cards, divided into Major and Minor Arcana.
- Major Arcana: 22 cards representing archetypal figures and concepts.
- Minor Arcana: 56 cards divided into four suits (Wands/Sceptres, Cups/Goblets, Swords, and Pentacles/Money), each with 14 cards (Ace to 10, plus King, Queen, Knight, and Knave). Each of these suits represent the four elements: Wands - Fire, Cups - Water, Swords - Air, and Pentacles - Earth.
- **Symbolism and Correspondences:** Papus emphasizes the importance of understanding the symbolism of the Tarot cards, connecting them to Hebrew letters, Kabbalistic principles, astrology, and mythology. He stresses that one must not be deceived by costume or incorrect figures, as the Hebrew letter will always be there to provide accurate interpretations. "As we have already said, all the letters are derived from one amongst them, the yod."
- **The Ternary and Trinity:** Papus highlights the significance of the ternary (groups of three) in understanding the universe, echoing concepts from various traditions like the Trimurti in Hinduism and the tri-grams of Fo-Hi in China. He connects it to the constitution of God: The Spirit of God (Father), the Soul of God (Son), and the Body of God (Holy Spirit). "I feel that hidden beneath this mystical formula of the Trinity is one of the most important scientific laws that man has ever discovered."
- **Involution and Evolution:** The concept of a cyclical movement in the universe, where Spirit descends into Matter (Involution) and Matter ascends back to Spirit (Evolution) through progressive synthesis.
- **Initiation:** Papus describes the Tarot as a tool for initiation, guiding the Neophyte through stages of self-discovery and spiritual development.
- **The Dragon of the Threshold:** The Tarot's cards represent the dangerous phase that one must confront and pass through in order to become a master of the celestial spheres, and access therapeutic skills. "This is Necromancy, the application of Force to the domination of inferior living beings: Elemental, or organisms ready to synthetize themselves, and Elementary, remains of the dead, on the way to disorganization."

## **III. Key Quotes:**

- "Therefore you must open the book and carefully weigh the statements made in it. Then you will know that the drug within is of very different value from the promise of the box, that is to say, that the subjects treated in it are not so frivolous as the title may imply."
- "It is one characteristic of the study of true occult science, that it may be freely explained to all men...we need, therefore, never be afraid of speaking too openly, the Word will only reach those who should be touched by it."
- "Starting from a fixed and immovable principle, the constitution of the sacred tetragrammaton, Yod–he–vau–he, the Tarot develops the most divers combinations, without one departure from its basis."
- "The knowledge of the property of the second He is the key to the whole divine name, in every application of which it is susceptible."
- "God, Man, and the Universe. This is the basis of all the esoteric philosophy of the ancients...Hermes Trismegistus, the Holy Kabbalah, Neo–Platonicism, and the Alchemists through Pythagoras and all the Greek philosophers assert the division of the Great All into THREE ENTITIES OR WORLDS."

## **IV. Implications:**

- Papus' work suggests that the Tarot is not just for fortune-telling but is a profound tool for understanding universal principles, achieving spiritual growth, and connecting with ancient wisdom.
- The emphasis on Kabbalistic and Hebrew symbolism highlights the importance of these traditions in Western occultism.
- The cyclical view of the universe (involution/evolution) provides a framework for understanding creation, destruction, and transformation.

## **V. Cautions:**

- Papus' interpretations are based on a specific occult tradition and may not align with all modern Tarot interpretations.
- The text assumes a certain level of familiarity with Kabbalah, astrology, and other esoteric systems, potentially making it challenging for beginners.
- The warnings regarding the Dragon of the Threshold and the dangers of unprepared initiation should be taken seriously by those interested in practical occultism.

# *Examine the concepts of Theosophical Addition and Theosophical Reduction and the presented interpretation of the Trinity as expressed by the Tetragrammaton*

The sources discuss the concepts of Theosophical Addition and Reduction, and the interpretation of the Trinity in relation to the Kabbalistic word Yod-He-Vau-He.

## **Theosophical Addition and Reduction:**

- These are described as operations that reveal the essential laws of nature and were part of secret oral instruction known as Esoterism.
- **Theosophical Reduction** involves reducing a number to a single digit by adding its digits together. For example: 126 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. This operation is related to the "proof by 9". It demonstrates that all numbers can be reduced to the first nine.
- **Theosophical Addition** calculates the theosophical value of a number by adding all numbers from unity up to that number. For example, the theosophical addition of 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

## **Yod-He-Vau-He and the Trinity:**

- According to the Kabbalah, **Yod-He-Vau-He** is a sacred word that holds the key to all sciences. It is composed of four Hebrew letters. The word is found at the head of every initiative ritual.
- Each letter in the name represents a different aspect:
    - **Yod** represents the active principle, the Ego, or Unity. It is the origin of all things, and all other letters are combinations of Yod. It corresponds to the number 1.
    - **He** represents the passive principle, the Non-Ego, or duality. It is the image of femininity and substance and corresponds to the number 2.
    - **Vau** signifies the link or analogy between the Ego and Non-Ego. It unites antagonisms and corresponds to the number 3.
    - **The second He** indicates the transition from the metaphysical to the physical world. It represents the complete being, comprising Ego, Non-Ego, and Affinity. It corresponds to the number 4 and becomes the Yod of the following sequence.
- The first three letters (Yod, He, Vau) express the Trinitarian law of the Absolute. The second He marks the passage from one world to another.
- **The sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing the active, the passive, the neuter, and a second active principle, corresponds with the series of the letters of the sacred name**. Pythagoras, who was initiated into the mysteries of the sacred word Yod–he–vau–he, replaced this word in his esoteric teachings by the sequence of the 4 first numbers or tetractys.
- The Kabbalistic sequence and the sequence of numbers are identical.
- The Tarot is based upon the word ROTA, arranged as a wheel. The word INRI indicates the unity of origin and the scientific and religious poles of the same doctrine. YOD–HE–VAU–HE indicates the unity of origin for Freemasons and Kabbalists.
- The analysis of Yod-He-Vau-He provides the general law upon which the Tarot is constructed. The four colors of the Tarot (Sceptre, Cup, Sword, and Pentacles) also relate to Yod-He-Vau-He.
- The Tetragrammaton is analogous to the four colors of the Tarot, with each color representing one of the letters.
- The four figures in the Tarot represent Yod-He-Vau-He.
- The first septenary of the Tarot corresponds to Yod, governing its correspondents in the minor series.
- The first card of the Tarot represents the Creator or Yod. The second represents the Receiver or He, and the third the Transformer or Vau.
- The Tarot defines God as the Absolute, with the Universe as body, Humanity as soul, and itself as Spirit.
- The divine name IEVE (Yod-He-Vau-He) consists of 4 letters. The cards are divided into 4 sections which repeat the divine name of 4 letters (IEVE) (הוהי) and form the passage from the ternary to the quaternary.
- The Divine Tetractys comprises: (1) the Absolute Being; (2) the Consciousness of the Absolute; (3) Love or the power of fecundity; (4) the realization of the virtualities of the Absolute.

# *How do Tarot colors relate to Yod-He-Vau-He?*

The tarot colors relate to the Kabbalistic word Yod-He-Vau-He, also known as the Tetragrammaton, as follows:

- **The four colors of the Tarot are the Sceptre, the Cup, the Sword, and the Pentacles**.
- These four colors are analogous to the tetragrammaton.
- **Each color corresponds to one of the letters in the sacred name Yod-He-Vau-He**:
    - **Sceptre** represents the Yod, which is the active or male principle. It is also represented by the episcopal crosier.
    - **Cup** represents the first He, which is the passive or feminine principle. It is also represented by the Chalice.
    - **Sword** represents the Vau, which is the union of the active and passive principles. The sword's cruciform symbolizes this union. It is also represented by the Cross.
    - **Pentacles** represent the second He, which is the transition from the natural to the supernatural world. The Pentacles are also represented by the Host.

Furthermore, the four colors considered as a whole show the application of the law Yod–he–vau–he. This law is reproduced in each of the colors taken separately.

# *What four principles do minor arcana represent?*

The minor arcana in the Tarot represent four principles:

- **Enterprise and Glory**, represented by the Sceptres. The Sceptres correspond to the Yod.
- **Love and Happiness**, represented by the Cups. The Cups correspond to the first He.
- **Hatred and Misfortune**, represented by the Swords. The Swords correspond to the Vau.
- **Money and Interest**, represented by the Pentacles. The Pentacles correspond to the second He.

# *What do the first four cards of the major arcana represent*

The first four cards of the major arcana in the Tarot represent a complete sequence that corresponds with the sacred word **Yod-He-Vau-He**. These cards form, both symbolically and numerically, a foundational structure within the Tarot.

- **Card 1: The Juggler** expresses the **active absolute** and corresponds with Yod. It signifies the **creative principle** of all numbers and is the active principle pre-eminent. It represents the **Creator or Divine**. The Juggler corresponds to the letter Aleph.
- **Card 2: The High Priestess** denotes the **reflex of the first**, the **passive absolute**, and corresponds with the first He. It represents the **Preserver or Astral**. It is formed by the first considered negatively.
- **Card 3: The Empress** indicates the **median term**, the **convertible transforming term**, corresponding to Vau. It represents the **Transformer** or Physical and Diffuser.
- **Card 4: The Emperor** is a **term of transition** between the preceding series and the one that follows it. It represents the **Generator** or Transitional becoming Creator. As the fourth card, it corresponds to the second He. The Emperor expresses in the active form all that the preceding card expressed in the passive.

The four first cards, symbolically as well as numerically, form a complete sequence, which corresponds with the sacred word Yod–he–vau–he. The symbolic series of the Tarot is represented completely by the four first cards, exactly as the numerical sequence is represented by the four first numbers. All the symbols of the Tarot are transformations of the first three, and these supply the general law of symbolism.

# *How do major and minor arcana differ?*

The major and minor arcana differ in their structure and symbolism.

## **Key Differences:**

- **Composition**: The Tarot deck contains 78 cards, divided into 56 minor arcana cards and 22 major arcana cards.
- **Figures and Numbers**: In the major arcana, figures and numbers are united, while in the minor arcana, they are distinct.
- **Numbering**: The major arcana consist of 21 numbered cards and one unnumbered card, while the minor arcana consist of 4 series of 14 cards each.
- **Symbolism**: Each card in the minor arcana has a symbol connecting it to the whole scheme (Sceptre, Cup, Sword, or Pentacles), whereas each card in the major arcana bears a different symbol.
- **Meaning**: The seven first cards of the major arcana primarily refer to the intellectual side of man, the seven next to the moral side, and the seven last to the various events of his material life.
- **Connection**: The Pentacles and the Ternary of transition establish the connection between the major and minor arcana.

## **Minor Arcana:**

- Consist of 56 cards divided into four suits or colors: Sceptres, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles.
    - Sceptres (or wands) correspond to clubs, representing enterprise and glory.
    - Cups (or goblets) correspond to hearts, representing love and happiness.
    - Swords correspond to spades, representing hatred and misfortune.
    - Pentacles (or money) correspond to diamonds, representing money and interest.

# *What did Egyptians divide the year into?*

The Egyptians divided the year as follows:

- **Four seasons**, each composed of three months.
- Each month contained **three decani or periods of ten days**, totaling three hundred and sixty days in each year.
- To complete the year, they added **a period of five days, or Epagomenes**, placed after the 30th degree of the Lion (August).

# *How do Tarot's major arcana link to planets?*

The major arcana in the Tarot are associated with the planets. In the astronomical Tarot, the **major arcana are represented by the septenary of the planets acting upon the three worlds** (3 x 7 = 21).

Each zodiacal sign and each decan is governed by a planet, and the connection between the planets and these different signs is indicated upon the tableau which follows. This tableau enables comprehension of the work that Christian and Ely Star accomplished upon Astrology and indicates the astronomical correspondence of every card in the Tarot.

In the twenty-first card of the Tarot, the origin of all its applications, the four figures in the corners represent the four seasons of the year and the four colors of the Tarot. **The center of the twenty-first card corresponds to the seven planets, which animate the yearly system**. Lastly, the zodiacal ellipse revolves between these two terms and contains the key to the influence exercised by the major arcana (the planets) over the minor arcana (the signs and decani).

Additionally, one source states that the seventh arcanum is central between the fifth and eleventh arcana. The significations of the fifth arcanum, corresponding to the letter He, is intelligence in the divine, and reflex of power in the human. The seventh arcanum expresses an arrow and suggests the idea of a weapon, of the instrument which man uses to rule and conquer, and to attain his object. The eleventh arcanum expresses only two ideas.

It is understood that life becomes clear in this region of the principles of the solar system, with its distribution from the solar centre to all the planets, and their reciprocal influences are understood in all their details, in what the occultists name the Correspondences. The Initiate is then master of Astrology in every branch of the science, in the widest meaning, of its acceptation.

# *What do the 1st seven major arcana represent?*

The first seven cards of the major arcana primarily refer to the intellectual side of man. Each of the cards in the first septenary relates to the others via the sacred word Yod-He-Vau-He. The first septenary corresponds to Yod and governs all the correspondents of Yod in the minor series. The first septenary represents the Divine World, God, and the Creator.

The first seven major arcana are:

- **Card 1: The Juggler** expresses the **active absolute** and corresponds with Yod. It signifies the creative principle of all numbers. The Juggler corresponds to the letter Aleph. God, Man, and the Universe are the three meanings of the first card. The Juggler holds the wand of the Mage in the left hand and raises it, and the four great symbols of the Tarot are placed before him.
- **Card 2: The High Priestess** denotes the **reflex of the first**, the **passive absolute**, and corresponds with the first He. It represents the Preserver or Astral. The High Priestess corresponds to the letter Beth. The High Priestess should be compared not only with the 1st arcanum, the Juggler, and the 3rd, the Empress, but also with the 5th arcanum, the Pope, with the 21st, the Universe, and even with the 18th, the Moon.
- **Card 3: The Empress** indicates the **median term**, the **convertible transforming term**, corresponding to Vau. The Empress corresponds to the letter Gimel. The creative principle and the receptive principle create a complete entity.
- **Card 4: The Emperor** is a **term of transition** between the preceding series and the one that follows it. The Emperor corresponds to the letter Daleth. The Emperor expresses in the active form all that the preceding card expressed in the passive.
- **Card 5: The Pope** corresponds with the letter He of the sacred word. It is the direct reflection of the 4th arcanum and the indirect reflection of the 2nd arcanum. In the Divine, the Pope is the reflex of the Will (INTELLIGENCE characteristic of God the Son).
- **Card 6: The Lovers** corresponds to the sixth Hebrew letter. It represents Love.
- **Card 7: The Chariot** corresponds to the letter Zain. Hieroglyphically the Zain expresses an arrow, and therefore it suggests the idea of a weapon, of the instrument which man uses to rule and conquer, and to attain his object. The 7th card of the Tarot shows the influence of the creation in the preservation of the Divine in the Human. The word Yod–he–vau–he is portrayed upon the front of the chariot by the winged globe, to indicate that the septenary gives the key to the whole Tarot.

## **Integration of Papus’ *The Tarot of the Bohemians***

### **1. Tetragrammaton (Yod-He-Vau-He) and the Trinity**
- **Papus’ Framework**:  
  - **Yod (י)**: Active principle, unity, origin (1), the Creator (Juggler).  
  - **He (ה)**: Passive principle, duality, feminine (2), the Preserver (High Priestess).  
  - **Vau (ו)**: Link between active/passive, analogy (3), the Transformer (Empress).  
  - **Second He (ה)**: Transition to physical, complete being (4), the Generator (Emperor).  
  - **Trinity**: Yod-He-Vau form a ternary (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), with the second He as manifestation into matter (Papus, p. 35).  
- **Fit into Model**:  
  - **Biblical Trinity**: Yod aligns with Father (Genesis 1:1, creator), He with Son (John 1:14, Word made flesh), Vau with Holy Spirit (John 3:8, unifying wind), and second He as creation’s realization (Revelation 21:1, new earth).  
  - **Lost Word**: The Tetragrammaton is the "sacred word" (Papus), akin to the Lost Word (YHWH/Logos), lost to the ruffians (ignorance, superstition, fear) but restored via initiation (Christ’s revelation, John 1:1).  
  - **Crossovers**: Theosophical Reduction (e.g., 126 = 9) and Addition (1+2+3+4 = 10) mirror biblical numerology—9 as completion (Revelation’s seals), 10 as divine order (Ten Commandments, Exodus 20). Papus’ ternary echoes the three ruffians/fish consuming the generative principle.

### **2. Metatron’s Cube and Platonic Solids**
- **Papus’ Framework**:  
  - **Four Suits (Minor Arcana)**: Sceptres (fire), Cups (water), Swords (air), Pentacles (earth), tied to Yod-He-Vau-He.  
  - **Major Arcana**: 22 cards, with the first septenary (1-7) reflecting Yod’s intellectual dominion, linked to planets and creation (e.g., Juggler/Yod as active absolute).  
  - **Card 21 (The World)**: Four figures (seasons/elements) surround a central planetary system, resonating with Metatron’s Cube’s 13 circles.  
- **Fit into Model**:  
  - **Platonic Solids**:  
    - **Tetrahedron/Fire**: Sceptres (Yod, enterprise/glory) match fire’s active energy (Exodus 3:2, burning bush).  
    - **Cube/Earth**: Pentacles (second He, money/interest) align with earth’s stability (Isaiah 66:1, footstool).  
    - **Octahedron/Air**: Swords (Vau, hatred/misfortune) reflect air’s duality (John 3:8, wind’s unseen force).  
    - **Icosahedron/Water**: Cups (first He, love/happiness) flow as water (Genesis 1:2, Spirit over waters).  
    - **Dodecahedron/Universe**: The World (card 21) ties to the universe/aether, encompassing all (Psalm 24:1).  
  - **Metatron’s Cube**: The 13 circles (Fruit of Life) parallel Tarot’s numerical structure—e.g., 1-4 (Yod-He-Vau-He) within 22 (Major Arcana). The cube solid (earth) as second He fits New Jerusalem’s cubic form (Revelation 21:16).  
  - **Crossovers**: The four suits mirror the four Holy Books and elements (e.g., Sceptres/Quran/fire), with Metatron’s scribe role (3 Enoch) echoing Papus’ Tarot as creation’s key.

### **3. Elemental Correspondence and Four Holy Books**
- **Papus’ Framework**:  
  - **Sceptres/Fire (Yod)**: Active, masculine, enterprise.  
  - **Cups/Water (He)**: Passive, feminine, love.  
  - **Swords/Air (Vau)**: Union, conflict, neuter.  
  - **Pentacles/Earth (Second He)**: Transition, material interest.  
- **Fit into Model**:  
  - **Four Holy Books**:  
    - **King James Bible (Water/Man)**: Cups/He, healing others (1 Corinthians 12:9), passive divine love (John 1:14).  
    - **Book of the Law (Air/Eagle)**: Swords/Vau, covert control (Liber AL III:70-72), linking Ego/Non-Ego (John 3:8, Spirit’s wind).  
    - **Quran (Fire/Lion)**: Sceptres/Yod, submission (Surah 5:33), active judgment (Revelation 19:15, sword from mouth).  
    - **Bhagavad Gita/Vedas (Earth/Ox)**: Pentacles/second He, self-healing (Gita 14:4), material transition (Genesis 1:9, dry land).  
  - **Biblical Elements**: Fire (Acts 2:3), water (Matthew 3:11), air (Genesis 2:7), earth (Genesis 1:10) align with suits and solids, reinforcing the four creatures (Revelation 4:7).  
  - **Crossovers**: The Tarot’s elemental suits enhance the fourfold elemental structure, with Yod-He-Vau-He as a biblical/Kabbalistic bridge (Exodus 3:14).

### **4. Generative Principle and Lost Word/Phallus**
- **Papus’ Framework**:  
  - **Juggler (Yod)**: Creative principle, the generative absolute (card 1).  
  - **Involution/Evolution**: Spirit descends into matter (He), links via Vau, and ascends (second He), mirroring Osiris’s phallus and Hiram’s Word as lost potency restored.  
  - **Dragon of the Threshold**: Ignorance, superstition, fear block this force, requiring initiation (Papus, p. 72).  
- **Fit into Model**:  
  - **Lost Word**: Yod as the Word (John 1:1) lost to ruffians (sin, Romans 5:12), restored by Christ (Revelation 5:5).  
  - **Lost Phallus**: Osiris’s generative force consumed by fish parallels the High Priestess (He) as passive potential, reborn via Vau (Empress) and second He (Emperor), akin to Christ’s resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:4).  
  - **Biblical Fit**: Genesis 1:3 (light) and John 8:12 (Christ as light) tie to the generative principle, consumed by the beast’s triad (Revelation 13), restored at Armageddon (Revelation 19).  
  - **Crossovers**: The Tarot’s first four cards (Yod-He-Vau-He) mirror the Lost Word/Phallus cycle—creation, loss, transformation, realization—fitting Eden’s Fall and redemption.

### **5. Trinity and Ternary**
- **Papus’ Framework**:  
  - **Ternary**: Yod-He-Vau as Spirit (Father), Soul (Son), Body (Holy Spirit), with second He as manifestation (Papus, p. 35).  
  - **Three Septenaries**: Major Arcana’s 21 cards (3x7) reflect divine, human, material worlds, rooted in Yod’s unity.  
- **Fit into Model**:  
  - **Trinity**: Father (Yod/active), Son (He/passive), Holy Spirit (Vau/link) align with Genesis 1:1-2 (God, Spirit over waters) and Matthew 28:19 (baptismal formula). Second He as New Jerusalem (Revelation 21) fits the cube.  
  - **Three Ruffians/Fish**: Ignorance, superstition, fear consuming the Trinity’s generative power (Logos/Phallus) mirror Satan’s opposition (Revelation 12:9).  
  - **Crossovers**: Papus’ ternary enhances the Trinity’s role in Metatron’s Cube, with solids (fire, earth, air, water) as creation’s expression, consumed yet restored.

## **Enhanced Model**
- **Metatron’s Cube**:  
  - **13 Circles**: Reflect Tarot’s numerical foundation (1-4 of Yod-He-Vau-He), with Yod as the central circle (Juggler/Creator).  
  - **Platonic Solids**: Sceptres (tetrahedron/fire), Cups (icosahedron/water), Swords (octahedron/air), Pentacles (cube/earth), with dodecahedron (universe) as The World (card 21).  
- **Elemental Mapping**:  
  - **Fire (Sceptres/Yod)**: Quran, active judgment, tetrahedron (Acts 2:3).  
  - **Water (Cups/He)**: Bible, passive healing, icosahedron (Genesis 1:2).  
  - **Air (Swords/Vau)**: Book of the Law, linking control, octahedron (John 3:8).  
  - **Earth (Pentacles/Second He)**: Vedas, material transition, cube (Revelation 21:16).  
- **Trinity**:  
  - **Yod-He-Vau**: Father-Son-Holy Spirit, with second He as the generative principle’s realization (Lost Word/Phallus restored).  
  - **Three Forces**: Ignorance (mob), superstition (church), fear (state) consume this, per Papus’ Dragon of the Threshold.  
- **Generative Principle**:  
  - **Lost Word/Phallus**: Yod (Juggler) as Logos/light (John 1:1), lost to ruffians/fish, restored via Tarot’s evolution (Emperor/second He, Christ’s return).

## Conclusion

**Conclusion in this mode**: Papus’ *The Tarot of the Bohemians* integrates seamlessly into the cube/Platonic/elemental/Trinity model. The Tetragrammaton (Yod-He-Vau-He) aligns with the Trinity (Father-Son-Holy Spirit) and Lost Word (Logos), with the second He as the cube’s materialization (New Jerusalem). The four suits (Sceptres/fire, Cups/water, Swords/air, Pentacles/earth) match Platonic solids and Holy Books, enhancing elemental crossovers. The generative principle (Word/Phallus) fits as Yod’s creative force, consumed by Papus’ Dragon (ignorance, superstition, fear), restored through Tarot’s initiatory ascent, mirroring biblical creation and redemption.

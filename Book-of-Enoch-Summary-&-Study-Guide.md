# **Briefing Document: The Book of Enoch**

## **I. Core Narrative and Themes:**

- **The Fall of the Watchers:** The primary narrative thread concerns the "sons of God" or "Watchers" who descended to Earth and cohabitated with human women. This resulted in the birth of giants and the corruption of mankind. "And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose... 4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown."
- This transgression led to the introduction of forbidden knowledge and technologies to humanity. "And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and taught them about metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of precious stones, and all coloring and dyes."
- **Divine Judgment and the Flood:** The wickedness resulting from the Watchers' actions prompted divine regret and a decision to cleanse the Earth through a great flood. "And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart." Noah, being righteous, found favor in God's eyes and was spared. "And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD."
- **Enoch as a Mediator and Prophet:** Enoch is presented as a righteous figure who ascends to heaven, receives divine revelations, and acts as an intercessor for both the Watchers and humanity. "I wrote out your petition, and in my vision it appeared that your petition will not be granted to you throughout all the days of eternity, and that judgment has been finally passed on you". He also receives detailed descriptions of the cosmos, the afterlife, and future events.
- **Cosmology and Angelic Hierarchy:** The texts offer a complex cosmology, detailing the structure of the heavens, the paths of celestial bodies, and the roles of various angels and spirits. "...I continued south and saw a place which bums day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones..." There is a distinct hierarchy among angels, with some, like Metatron, holding particularly exalted positions. "Here Metatron is given the omniscient power of God." "God puts a crown on him and calls him "the Lesser YHWH""
- **The Elect One/Messiah:** Some sections refer to a future "Elect One" or Messiah who will bring judgment and establish a righteous kingdom. "All these things which you have seen shall serve the authority of His Messiah that he may be powerful and mighty on the earth."
- **Moral and Ethical Teachings:** The books contain moral exhortations, warnings against sin, and calls for righteousness, justice, and compassion. "Woe to you who drink water from every fountain (drink water all the time ), for suddenly shall you be consumed and wither away, because you have forsaken the fountain of life."

## **II. Key Ideas and Concepts:**

- **Azazel's Role in Corruption:** Azazel is specifically named as being responsible for teaching forbidden arts and technologies, leading to the corruption of humanity. "The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe ALL SIN."
- **The Nature of Sin and Judgment:** Sin is depicted as a pervasive force that corrupts both individuals and the Earth itself. Divine judgment is portrayed as inevitable and severe for the unrepentant. "He is righteous also in His j udgment, and in the presence of His glory unrighteousness also shall not stand: At His judgment the unrepentant shall perish before Him."
- **The Importance of Righteousness:** Righteousness is presented as the path to salvation and divine favor. "Blessed is the man who dies in righteousness and goodness, concerning whom there is no book of unrighteousness written, and against whom no day of judgment shall be found."
- **The Spiritual Nature of Creation:** The excerpts emphasize the spiritual dimensions of creation and the interaction between the physical and spiritual realms. "...from the secret recesses of the mountains come beautiful waters, from the creation of the world and to eternity."
- **The Role of Angels:** Angels act as intermediaries between God and humanity, executing divine will and guarding aspects of creation. "...These are the angels who descended to the earth, and revealed what was hidden to the children of men and seduced the children of men into committing sin."
- **Metatron's Significance:** Metatron is presented as an elevated angel who has access to divine mysteries and holds significant authority in the heavenly realm. "And I arranged all the works of creation for him. And I made him more powerful than all the ministering angels."
- **Determinism vs. Free Will:** There is a tension between the idea of predestination and the emphasis on individual responsibility and the call to repentance. "...every man that has been in his mother's womb has had a place prepared for the repose of that soul, and a measure predetermined of how much it is intended that a man be tried (tested) in this world." Vs. "For He will this to others that they may repent and turn away from the works of their hands."

# *What theological concepts are found in the Books of Enoch, and what impact?*

The Books of Enoch contain theological concepts that seem to have had an impact on both Jewish and Christian theology. The texts address the origin and purpose of various aspects of the world, including angels, the cosmos, and the coming kingdom. The theological importance of the Books of Enoch is underscored by the fact that they were once valued by both Jews and Christians.

## Key theological concepts found in the Books of Enoch:

- **The Elect One**: The "Elect One" is a significant term found multiple times in the Book of Enoch, used to describe one who shall "sit upon the throne of glory" and "dwell in the midst of them". Some interpret the "voice out of the cloud" as reference to the "Elect One" promised in the Book of Enoch.
- **Influence on New Testament writers**: There is a strong possibility that the Books of Enoch, especially 1 Enoch, influenced the thought and theology of New Testament writers. Many references in Enoch are reminiscent of passages in the New Testament. Some scholars consider 1 Enoch a missing link between Jewish and Christian theology, with its theology appearing more Christian than Jewish.
- **Judgment and the Consummation of the Age**: Some visions in Enoch allude to the consummation of the age in conjunction with Christ's second coming, believed to have occurred in A.D. 70 during the destruction of Jerusalem. The Book of Jude makes a direct reference to the Book of Enoch, specifically referencing the execution of judgment on all and the conviction of the ungodly.
- **The Fall of the Watchers and the Origin of Evil**: The Books of Enoch explain evil as originating from demons, believed to be the offspring of angels who fell due to lust for women, drawing directly from Enochian writings. The narrative details how the Watchers, who had left their high, holy, and eternal heaven, defiled themselves with women, leading to great destruction on earth.
- **The Coming Kingdom and Righteousness**: Enoch is filled with mentions of the coming kingdom and holy themes. It speaks of a time when all the children of men shall become righteous, all nations will offer adoration, and the earth will be cleansed from defilement, sin, and punishment.
- **Cosmology and the Heavens**: The texts describe Enoch's ascent through multiple heavens, where he is transfigured into an angel and granted access to the secrets of creation. These include storehouses of snow and dew in the First Heaven, fallen angels in the Second Heaven, and a Gnostic diversion that includes Archas and Adoil.
- **Metatron**: 3 Enoch describes Enoch's transformation into the angel Metatron, who is given authority over the angels and earthly nations. Metatron is also called "The Lesser YHWH".

## Impact and Significance:

- **Early Christian Acceptance**: Many early Christians considered the Books of Enoch as scripture, with church fathers referencing and quoting from them. The early second-century apocryphal book of the Epistle of Barnabas and second and third-century church fathers like Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origin, and Clement of Alexandria seemed to accept Enoch as authentic.
- **Influence on Jesus**: It is suggested that Jesus studied the Book of Enoch and alluded to its doctrine and content. There are numerous comments in the New Testament that find precedence in the Book of Enoch.
- **Rejection and Rediscovery**: Despite its early acceptance, the Books of Enoch were eventually rejected by some theologians and declared a fake. However, a copy of 1 Enoch was preserved by the Ethiopian church, and the rediscovery of these texts has led to a reconsideration of their influence on religious thought.

# *How did early Christians view Enoch's writings?*

Early Christians held diverse views regarding the writings attributed to Enoch. While many accepted them as inspired or authentic, others questioned or rejected their content.

Evidence of the acceptance of Enoch's writings by early Christians:

- **Regarded as Scripture**: Some early Christians considered the Books of Enoch as scripture. Tertullian (160-230 A.D.) even called the Book of Enoch "Holy Scripture".
- **Influence on New Testament Writers**: There is a strong possibility that the Books of Enoch, especially 1 Enoch, influenced the thought and theology of New Testament writers.
- **References by Church Fathers**: The literature of the church fathers is filled with references to the Book of Enoch. Early figures such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Origen, and Clement of Alexandria seemed to accept Enoch as authentic. The early second-century apocryphal book, the Epistle of Barnabas, makes many references and quotes from the Book of Enoch.
- **Impact on Understanding**: Early Christians relied on the Book of Enoch to understand the origin and purpose of many things, from angels to wind, sun, and stars.
- **Connection to Jesus**: Key concepts used by Jesus Christ himself seem directly connected to terms and ideas in the Book of Enoch. It is hard to avoid the evidence that Jesus not only studied the book, but also respected it highly enough to allude to its doctrine and content.
- **The "Elect One"**: If the book was indeed known to the apostles of Christ, with its abundant descriptions of the Elect One who should "sit upon the throne of glory" and the Elect One who should "dwell in the midst of them," then the great scriptural authenticity is justly accorded to the Book of Enoch when the "voice out of the cloud" tells the apostles, "This is my Son, the Elect One," . . . the one promised in the Book of Enoch.

Reasons for questioning or rejecting Enoch's writings:

- **Theological Problems**: Since any book stands to be interpreted in many ways, 1 Enoch posed problems for some theologians. Instead of reexamining their own theology, they sought to dispose of that which went counter to their beliefs.
- **Visions and the Second Coming**: Some of the visions in Enoch are believed to point to the consummation of the age in conjunction with Christ's second coming which took place in A.D. 70 (in the destruction of Jerusalem).
- **Declared a Fake**: 1 Enoch was declared a fake and was rejected by Hilary, Jerome, and Augustine.

Despite varying views, the influence of the Book of Enoch on early Christian thought is evident in the numerous references and allusions found in early Christian literature. Its themes and concepts resonated with many early Christians and helped shape their understanding of key theological ideas.

# *What materials become useless during judgement day?*

During the days of judgment, according to the Book of Enoch, the following materials will become useless:

- There will be **no iron for war**.

- **Bronze** will be of no use.
- **Tin** will be worthless.
- **Lead** will not be desired.

These materials will be destroyed from the face of the earth when the Elect One appears before the Lord of spirits. Kings who possess the land will be ashamed because they will not be able to save themselves on the day of anguish. They will be given over into the hands of the elect. They shall burn before the face of the holy and sink before the face of the righteous, and no trace of them shall be found anymore, for they have denied the Lord of spirits and His Anointed.

# *How do Watchers defile mankind, and why?*

The Watchers defile mankind by several means, primarily by revealing heavenly secrets, teaching forbidden knowledge, and interbreeding with human women.

The Book of Enoch details these transgressions:

- **Lust and Interbreeding**: The angels, the sons of heaven, lusted after human women and took them as wives, which was against God's design. This defiled them and humanity.
- **Teaching Forbidden Knowledge**: The Watchers taught humans forbidden knowledge such as the art of making weapons, charms, spells, root cuttings, astrology, and other crafts. Azazel, in particular, is said to have taught men to make swords, knives, shields, breastplates, metals, bracelets, ornaments, the use of antimony, precious stones, coloring and dyes. Semjaza taught the casting of spells and root-cuttings, Armaros taught counter-spells, Baraqijal taught astrology, Kokabel taught the constellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the course of the moon.
- **Corruption and Impiety**: This led to great impiety, turning away from God, fornication, corruption, and lawlessness.
- **Bearing Giants**: The women bore giants who consumed the toil of men and devoured mankind, leading to sin against birds, beasts, reptiles, and fish. The giants began to devour one another's flesh and drink blood. The earth was filled with blood and unrighteousness.
- **Revealing Secrets**: The Watchers revealed eternal secrets that were made and kept in heaven, which men were striving to learn.
- **Sacrificing to Demons**: The spirits of the angels who had sex with women assumed many different forms, defiling mankind and leading them astray into sacrificing to demons as gods.

The reasons the Watchers are said to have defiled mankind are:

- **Breaking Divine Order**: The Watchers transgressed the commandments of the Lord. They abandoned their high, holy, and eternal heaven to engage in earthly desires, which was not their place.
- **Defilement**: By having sex with women and begetting children with the blood of flesh, they defiled themselves, even though they were initially holy and spiritual.
- **Unrighteousness**: Azazel taught all unrighteousness on earth. The Watchers' actions led to widespread sin, violence, and corruption.
- **Lack of Peace**: As a consequence of their actions, the Watchers would have no peace or forgiveness of sin.
- **Judgment**: The Most High said that Uriel is to go to the son of Lamech and the Lord commanded Raphael to bind Azazel and cast him into darkness.
- **Corruption of the Earth**: The whole earth was corrupted through the works taught by Azazel, to whom all sin is ascribed.
- **Desire for Eternal Life**: The Watchers hoped to live an eternal life, but their request would not be granted.
- **Wronging Mankind**: The spirits of lust and the children of the Watchers wronged mankind, and they were to be destroyed. The earth was to be cleansed from all oppression, unrighteousness, sin, and godlessness.

They shall burn before the face of the holy and sink before the face of the righteous, and no trace of them shall be found anymore. Hell (Sheol) shall devour the sinners in the presence of the elect.
- **Uselessness of Material Wealth**: Gold and silver will not save anyone, and there will be no iron for war. Bronze, tin, and lead will be worthless and destroyed from the face of the earth when the Elect One appears.
- **Light and Joy for the Righteous**: The righteous and elect shall be saved and never again see the face of the sinners and unrighteous. The Lord of spirits will abide over them, and they shall eat, lie down, and rise up with the Son of Man forever. The righteous and elect shall have risen from the earth and be clothed with garments of life.
